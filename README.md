# About
Passionate about solving real problems by developing people and software,
I breathe technology for over 10 years and have 6+ years of experience with software development.

I believe that the software becomes better from the moment that people feel happy doing what they like.
For me, programming languages and frameworks are constantly a work in progress. In my free time, I invest in learning new ones.

I am currently focused on the javascript/typescript stack on the frontend and backend as well (yes, I struggle to deliver a complete end-to-end solution with high quality).

I've had the opportunity to work with different programming languages, such as Java, Ruby, Javascript and recently with Golang.
During my professional life, I was responsible for developing many services and integrations as well as front end applications, especially with React (client and server-side).


**I'm happy delivering value to the company, people and customers.**

I started leading the backend team, developing data import services, backend for the frontend, pub/sub services and apis to be consumed by third parties.

At that time, I participated in the prototyping and helping the team in the migration of the main product api to graphql and typescript.

Over time I also assumed the position of technical leadership of the frontend, prototyping and helping the team to develop the frontend v2 with typescript and graphql.

After some time I also helped the QA team to develop a project for automated testing using ruby.

### **Cloud POC**
The system was legacy and ran on the customers' local computer with a local database, at that point I participated in a study on the evolution of architecture to the cloud.

So, we implemented a proof of concept using ruby on rails and also angularjs (the final choice)

With the creation of system modules developed in the cloud, it was necessary to create a middleware that ran on the clients' machines to expose the local database to the cloud and thus make specific queries for each client.

For security issues I have written an authentication and authorization layer based on [RFC6759](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) Oauth2.0 this was written in NodeJS.

During the development of this service, the need arose to test the oauth2 flow, that's when I discovered the was necessary to implement unit and integration testing using mochajs and chaijs
